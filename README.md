# Practice: User Management Operations (SQL)

This practice project focuses on creating, filtering, and merging data tables using SQL.

## What I Learned

1. How to create SQL tables and populate them with data.
2. How to filter data using `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING` clauses.
3. How to join related tables using `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN`.
4. How to use subqueries (scalar, column, and table subqueries) to filter and analyze data.

## What I Found Most Challenging

Overall, the material was fairly straightforward. The main challenge was becoming comfortable with SQL syntax, which I expect will improve with continued practice.
